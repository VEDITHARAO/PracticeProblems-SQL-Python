Table: Tasks

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| task_id     | int  |
| assignee_id | int  |
| submit_date | date |
+-------------+------+
task_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row in this table contains the ID of a task, the id of the assignee, and the submission date.
 

Write an SQL query to report:

the number of the tasks that were submitted during the weekend (Saturday, Sunday) as weekend_cnt, and
the number of the tasks that were submitted during the working days as working_cnt.
Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is shown in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Tasks table:
+---------+-------------+-------------+
| task_id | assignee_id | submit_date |
+---------+-------------+-------------+
| 1       | 1           | 2022-06-13  |
| 2       | 6           | 2022-06-14  |
| 3       | 6           | 2022-06-15  |
| 4       | 3           | 2022-06-18  |
| 5       | 5           | 2022-06-19  |
| 6       | 7           | 2022-06-19  |
+---------+-------------+-------------+
Output: 
+-------------+-------------+
| weekend_cnt | working_cnt |
+-------------+-------------+
| 3           | 3           |
+-------------+-------------+

--SOLUTION
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT 
COUNT(IF(DAYNAME(submit_date) IN ('Saturday','Sunday'), submit_date,null))  as weekend_cnt,
COUNT(IF(DAYNAME(submit_date) NOT IN ('Saturday','Sunday'), submit_date,null)) as working_cnt
from Tasks;
